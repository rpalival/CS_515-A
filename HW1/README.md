* What is the difference between print and return in Python? Answer in just a sentence or two. You can use an example if you like.  
Print statment returns a final output to the console and it's job is done, but return returns an output from an excecution than will be further used in the code
* Are there any known bugs or issues with your program? Even if the answer is no, please include this question and just say 'no'.
* Describe an issue that you encountered and resolved when writing and testing your code. It doesn't have to be complex, but it should be something that didn't work the first time. Tell us a about it---what were you trying to do, what went wrong, and how did you fix it?
