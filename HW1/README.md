* What is the difference between print and return in Python? Answer in just a sentence or two. You can use an example if you like.  
    A) Print statement returns a final output to the console and it's job is done, but return returns an output from an excecution which can be further used in the code.
* Are there any known bugs or issues with your program? Even if the answer is no, please include this question and just say 'no'.  
    A) No bugs or issues.
* Describe an issue that you encountered and resolved when writing and testing your code. It doesn't have to be complex, but it should be something that didn't work the first time. Tell us a about it---what were you trying to do, what went wrong, and how did you fix it?  
    A) I wanted to run the try and except block to catch the invalid input of the grading letter program but was facing some indentation error, to fix it I just removed the try catch block from outside the function block and moved it inside the function block and it seemed to solve my issue.
